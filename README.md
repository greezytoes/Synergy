# Synergy: A Development Framework Grounded in Autonomous Synergy

**Status: Active Development (Beta)**

## Overview

Synergy is an advanced development framework grounded in the principle of autonomous synergy. Built using Microsoft's AutoGen library (v0.4.9), it orchestrates dynamically instanstiated specialized AI agents within a highly collaborative and environment managed by a central architect, Daedalus.

The core philosophy emphasizes **dynamic adaptation**: individual features, technology developed internally and all agent roles are designed to adjust to specific task requirements. During specific phases of development this dynamic adapting can even be done mid-task ("on the fly"). Furthermore, these features are architected to work **synergistically together**, creating itelligent, emergent capabilities beyond the sum of their parts. This is true in all aspects of development, especially the UI/UX design.

This holistic synergy aims to enable the rapid development of complex, large-scale software applications with **unparalleled quality**, particularly in UI/UX design and practical functionality, approaching the efficiency often associated with smaller projects.

This repository tracks the ongoing development, design decisions, and progress towards this vision.

## Core Proposed Features

*   **Daedalus Architect:** A central coordinating agent responsible for task decomposition, team assembly, and overall project oversight.
*   **Specialized Agent Teams:** Dynamically assembled teams focusing on specific domains like UI/UX Design, Development (with various language/framework specializations), Testing, Quality Control, and Documentation.
*   **Strict UI/UX Standards:** A dedicated UI/UX team ensures adherence to modern design principles, focusing on usability, accessibility, and a specific high-quality aesthetic (e.g., dark themes, neomorphism/glassmorphism influences).
*   **Modular Agent Architecture:** Utilizes a `Base Role` + `Augment` system, allowing agents to be dynamically specialized with specific skills, toolsets, or knowledge areas.
*   **Hybrid Memory System:** Incorporates both short-term conversational context and a long-term, self-improving knowledge base (likely vector-based with caching) to learn from past interactions and improve performance.
*   **Integrated Monitoring:** Plans include integration with monitoring tools (like AgentOps) via a custom dashboard for observing agent interactions, performance, and decision-making processes.
*   **Quality Control Gates:** Multi-layered validation steps ensure code quality, design fidelity, functional correctness, and documentation standards are met.

## Roadmap Overview (High-Level)

Development follows an incremental, core-first approach. See `roadmap.md` for the detailed, step-by-step plan.

*   **Phase 0:** Foundation Setup
*   **Phase 1:** Minimal Agent Core
*   **Phase 2:** Basic Task Execution & File I/O
*   **Phase 3:** Group Chat Introduction
*   **Phase 4:** Basic Memory Integration
*   **Phase 5:** Augmentation Concept & Prompt Engineering
*   **Phase 6:** Basic Testing & QC Roles
*   **Phase 7:** Basic Design & Documentation Roles
*   **Phase 8:** Iterative Feature Expansion
*   **Phase 9:** Scaling & Optimization
